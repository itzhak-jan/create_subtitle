    "clarificationsList1": "<li><strong>Audio-Based Transcription Only:</strong> The tool \"listens\" to the audio and converts it to text. It does not \"see\" the video or understand visual context.</li><li><strong>Sensitivity to Noise and Audio Quality:</strong> Transcription quality is highly dependent on the original file's audio quality. Background noise, loud music, unclear or overlapping speech, and multiple speakers can cause many errors.</li><li><strong>Names, Terms, and Unique Phrases:</strong> The language model (especially the small version running in the browser) may struggle to correctly identify proper names, place names, brands, professional jargon, or slang.</li><li><strong>Relatively Small Language Model:</strong> To run in your browser, this tool uses a relatively small version of the Whisper model. Larger versions (which require powerful servers) can offer higher accuracy.</li><li><strong>Performance Depends on Your Computer:</strong> All processing is done on your machine. The transcription time directly depends on your computer's processing power and the file length. Very long files may take a long time or even fail on weaker computers.</li>",
